# Learning Python packaging with Pixi

## Introduction
This lesson introduces the basics of Python packaging using a tool called [Pixi](https://prefix.dev/).
This course is designed for intermediate Python users.

======= Abstract========

Packaging is one of the most critical yet overlooked skills for Python developers. This course introduces you to **modern, reliable, and reproducible packaging workflows** using **Pixi**, a powerful tool that combines the best of PyPI and Conda<sup>*</sup>.

Through hands-on lessons, you’ll learn:

- Why packaging matters for reproducibility, versioning, and collaboration.
- How to structure Python projects with best practices.
- Managing dependencies and lockfiles with Pixi for consistent environments.
- Writing clear and complete metadata (pyproject.toml / pixi.toml).
- Building Python packages (source + wheel distributions).
- Publishing your projects to TestPyPI and PyPI<sup>*</sup> using Twine.

By the end of the course, you will:

- Understand the complete packaging workflow from idea → distribution → installation.
- Be able to confidently release your own Python packages to the community.
- Gain a reproducible, professional workflow for managing Python projects.

This course is ideal for Python developers, data scientists, and researchers who want to share their work, ensure reproducibility, and adopt industry-standard packaging practices, without the usual complexity.

# The Carpentries Workbench Template Markdown Lesson

This lesson is a template lesson that uses [The Carpentries Workbench][workbench]. 

## Note about lesson life cycle stage
Although the `config.yaml` states the life cycle stage as pre-alpha, **the template is stable and ready to use**. The life cycle stage is preset to `"pre-alpha"` as this setting is appropriate for new lessons initialised using the template.

## Create a new repository from this template

To use this template to start a new lesson repository, 
make sure you're logged into Github.   
Visit https://github.com/carpentries/workbench-template-md/generate
and follow the instructions.
Checking the 'Include all branches' option will save some time waiting for the first website build
when your new repository is initialised.

If you have any questions, contact [@tobyhodges](https://github.com/tobyhodges)

## Configure a new lesson

Follow the steps below to
complete the initial configuration of a new lesson repository built from this template:

1. **Make sure GitHub Pages is activated:**
   navigate to _Settings_,
   select _Pages_ from the left sidebar,
   and make sure that `gh-pages` is selected as the branch to build from.
   If no `gh-pages` branch is available, check the _Actions_ tab to see if the first
   website build workflows are still running.
   If they're not running yet, you may need to manually enable them via the _Actions_ tab.
   The branch should become available when those have completed.
1. **Adjust the `config.yaml` file:**
   this file contains global parameters for your lesson site.
   Individual fields within the file are documented with comments (beginning with `#`)
   At minimum, you should adjust all the fields marked 'FIXME':
   - `title`
   - `created`
   - `keywords`
   - `life_cycle` (the default, _pre-alpha_, is the appropriate for brand new lessons)
   - `contact`
1. **Annotate the repository** with site URL and topic tags:
   navigate back to the repository landing page and
   click on the gear wheel/cog icon (similar to ⚙️) 
   at the top-right of the _About_ box.
   Check the "Use your GitHub Pages website" option,
   and [add some keywords and other annotations to describe your lesson](https://cdh.carpentries.org/the-carpentries-incubator.html#topic-tags)
   in the _Topics_ field.
   At minimum, these should include:
   - `lesson`
   - the life cycle of the lesson (e.g. `pre-alpha`)
   - the human language the lesson is written in (e.g. `deutsch`)
1. **Adjust the 
   `CITATION.cff`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and `LICENSE.md` files**
   as appropriate for your project.
   -  `CITATION.cff`:
      this file contains information that people can use to cite your lesson,
      for example if they publish their own work based on it.
      You should [update the CFF][cff-sandpaper-docs] now to include information about your lesson,
      and remember to return to it periodically, keeping it updated as your
      author list grows and other details become available or need to change.
      The [Citation File Format home page][cff-home] gives more information about the format,
      and the [`cffinit` webtool][cffinit] can be used to create new and update existing CFF files.
   -  `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`: 
      if you are using this template for a project outside The Carpentries,
      you should adjust this file to describe 
      who should be contacted with Code of Conduct reports,
      and how those reports will be handled.
   -  `CONTRIBUTING.md`:
      depending on the current state and maturity of your project,
      the contents of the template Contributing Guide may not be appropriate.
      You should adjust the file to help guide contributors on how best
      to get involved and make an impact on your lesson.
   -  `LICENSE.md`:
      in line with the terms of the CC-BY license,
      you should ensure that the copyright information 
      provided in the license file is accurate for your project.
1. **Update this README with 
   [relevant information about your lesson](https://carpentries.github.io/lesson-development-training/collaborating-newcomers.html#readme)**
   and delete this section.
