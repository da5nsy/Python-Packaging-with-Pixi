# Learning Python packaging with Pixi

## Introduction
This lesson introduces the basics of Python packaging using a tool called [Pixi](https://prefix.dev/).
This course is designed for intermediate Python users.

======= **Abstract**========

Packaging is one of the most critical yet overlooked skills for Python developers. This course introduces you to **modern, reliable, and reproducible packaging workflows** using **Pixi**, a powerful tool that combines the best of PyPI and Conda<sup>*</sup>.

Through hands-on lessons, you’ll learn:

- Why packaging matters for reproducibility, versioning, and collaboration.
- How to structure Python projects with best practices.
- Managing dependencies and lockfiles with Pixi for consistent environments.
- Writing clear and complete metadata (pyproject.toml / pixi.toml).
- Building Python packages (source + wheel distributions).
- Publishing your projects to TestPyPI and PyPI<sup>*</sup> using Twine.

By the end of the course, you will:

- Understand the complete packaging workflow from idea → distribution → installation.
- Be able to confidently release your own Python packages to the community.
- Gain a reproducible, professional workflow for managing Python projects.

This course is ideal for Python developers, data scientists, and researchers who want to share their work, ensure reproducibility, and adopt industry-standard packaging practices, without the usual complexity.
