## Introduction

It is important to structure your project properly and include the necessary files, while giving unique yet understandable package names.

Packages are a way to organize modules in a Python project. A project can contain several modules, and grouping them into packages helps keep the code organized and maintainable.

Every package should have a special file called __init__.py in its folder. The presence of this file signals to Python that the folder is a package, allowing it to be imported later in your code.

## Project Structure
A typical project would look like :
```greet_me/
â””â”€â”€ my_package/
    â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
    â”œâ”€â”€ happy.py
    â””â”€â”€ sad.py
```
Lets create the same structure for our project in the codespace.
 
```python
# happy.py
def greet_happy():
    return "Yay! Iâ€™m so happy to see you! ðŸ˜€"
```
```python
# sad.py
def greet_sad():
    return "Oh noâ€¦ Iâ€™m feeling a bit down today. ðŸ˜¢"
```
Ultimately, Our project structure should look like this : 
```
greet_me/
â”œâ”€â”€ LICENSE
â”œâ”€â”€ pyproject.toml
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ pixi.toml
â”œâ”€â”€ pixi.lock         # auto-generated, do not edit
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ test_greetings.py
â””â”€â”€ my_package/
    â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
    â”œâ”€â”€ happy.py
    â””â”€â”€ sad.py
```
