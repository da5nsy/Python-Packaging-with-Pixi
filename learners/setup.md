<!--FIXME: Setup instructions live in this document. Please specify the tools and
the data sets the Learner needs to have installed.

## Data Sets


FIXME: place any data you want learners to use in `episodes/data` and then use
       a relative link ( [data zip file](data/lesson-data.zip) ) to provide a
       link to it, replacing the example.com link.

Download the [data zip file](https://example.com/FIXME) and unzip it to your Desktop -->

## Software Setup

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: discussion

### Details

For this course, we will use GitHub Codespaces, providing a cloud-based development environment that runs directly in your web browser.
This setup means no local software installation is required on your personal computer, simplifying our getting-started process.
Your Codespace environment is Linux-based, so we will be using standard Linux commands and tools throughout
