## Introduction

Pixi is a fast and reproducible package management tool. It has lots of [features](https://pixi.sh/latest/#what-is-the-difference-with-pixi) which are not all present in a single tool at this point in time. Hence we choose this tool.
It comes with following features : 
- Native supprt for both PyPI packages and conda
- Modern
- Support for multi-language dependency ( E.g. RUST + Python, or Python + C++)
- Uses 'uv' under the hood.
- Helps with reproducibility via 'pixi.lock'
